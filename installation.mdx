description: Install TeX Live and compile CVs locally with pdfLaTeX or Docker
---

## Local installation

For full control over your CV compilation and offline editing, you can install a TeX distribution on your local machine.

## Requirements

A full TeX distribution is required to compile the CV templates. The recommended option is **TeX Live**, which works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

<Note>
  If you don't want to install TeX on your system, you can use Docker instead (see below).
</Note>

## Installing TeX Live

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    ### Option 1: Install from upstream (recommended)
    
    Installing TeX Live from upstream gives you the most up-to-date packages:
    
    1. Download the install script from [tug.org/texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html)
    2. Run the installer and select the full scheme
    
    See the [TeX Live installation guide](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) for detailed instructions.
    
    ### Option 2: Install from package manager
    
    For Ubuntu/Debian:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install texlive-full
    ```
    
    For Fedora:
    
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-full
    ```
    
    For Arch Linux:
    
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S texlive-most
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      Package manager versions may be outdated. Installing from upstream is recommended for the latest features.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="macOS">
    ### MacTeX (recommended)
    
    MacTeX is the standard TeX distribution for macOS:
    
    1. Download MacTeX from [tug.org/mactex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)
    2. Open the `.pkg` file and follow the installer
    3. The installation includes TeX Live, LaTeXiT, and other useful tools
    
    ### Homebrew
    
    Alternatively, install via Homebrew:
    
    ```bash
    brew install --cask mactex
    ```
    
    This will download and install the full MacTeX distribution.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ### TeX Live on Windows
    
    1. Download the network installer from [tug.org/texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html)
    2. Run `install-tl-windows.exe`
    3. Select the full installation scheme
    4. Wait for the installation to complete (may take 30+ minutes)
    
    ### MiKTeX (alternative)
    
    MiKTeX is another popular TeX distribution for Windows:
    
    1. Download from [miktex.org](https://miktex.org/download)
    2. Run the installer
    3. Choose to install missing packages on-the-fly when prompted
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Cloning the repository

Once TeX Live is installed, clone the CV Template repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mirza42069/CV_Template.git
cd CV_Template
```

## Compiling your CV

<CodeGroup>

```bash pdfLaTeX
cd examples
pdflatex cv_en.tex
```

```bash Makefile
make
```

```bash Docker
docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -i -w "/doc" -v "$PWD/examples":/doc texlive/texlive:latest pdflatex cv_en.tex
```

</CodeGroup>

### Using pdfLaTeX directly

Navigate to the `examples` directory and compile:

```bash
cd examples
pdflatex cv_en.tex
```

This will generate `cv_en.pdf` in the same directory.

<Note>
  You may see warnings about overfull hboxes - these are usually safe to ignore and won't affect the final PDF.
</Note>

To compile the Indonesian version:

```bash
pdflatex cv_id.tex
```

### Using the Makefile

From the project root, run:

```bash
make
```

This will compile both `cv_en.pdf` and `cv_id.pdf` in the `examples` directory. The Makefile runs `pdflatex` twice for each file to ensure all references are resolved correctly.

**Makefile targets:**

- `make all` or `make` - Compile both English and Indonesian CVs
- `make examples/cv_en.pdf` - Compile only the English CV
- `make examples/cv_id.pdf` - Compile only the Indonesian CV
- `make clean` - Remove auxiliary files (`.aux`, `.log`, `.out`, etc.)

### Using Docker

If you don't want to install TeX Live locally, you can use the official TeX Live Docker image:

```bash
docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -i -w "/doc" \
  -v "$PWD/examples":/doc \
  texlive/texlive:latest \
  pdflatex cv_en.tex
```

**What this command does:**

- `--rm` - Remove the container after compilation
- `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)` - Run as your user (prevents permission issues)
- `-w "/doc"` - Set working directory inside container
- `-v "$PWD/examples":/doc` - Mount the examples directory
- `texlive/texlive:latest` - Use the official TeX Live image
- `pdflatex cv_en.tex` - Compile the English CV

<Warning>
  The first time you run this command, Docker will download the TeX Live image, which is several gigabytes and may take a while.
</Warning>

## File structure

After cloning the repository, you'll see this structure:

```
examples/
  cv_en.tex             English CV template (edit this)
  cv_id.tex             Indonesian CV template (edit this)
  cv_en.pdf             Compiled English PDF
  cv_id.pdf             Compiled Indonesian PDF
  cv_en.png             Preview screenshot (English)
  cv_id.png             Preview screenshot (Indonesian)
cv_template.cls         Reference class file (not used by templates)
.github/workflows/compile-pdfs.yml   GitHub Actions CI for PDF compilation
CV_Template_Overleaf.zip    Ready-to-upload ZIP for Overleaf
Makefile                Build script (make all)
```

<Note>
  The example templates (`cv_en.tex` and `cv_id.tex`) don't use `cv_template.cls`. They are self-contained with all styling defined inline. The class file is included as a reference for advanced users who want to create a custom class.
</Note>

## Continuous integration

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically compiles PDFs on every push:

```yaml .github/workflows/compile-pdfs.yml
name: Compile PDFs

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Compile LaTeX documents
        uses: xu-cheng/latex-action@v2
        with:
          root_file: |
            examples/cv_en.tex
            examples/cv_id.tex
```

This ensures your PDFs are always up to date with your source files.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing packages

If you get errors about missing packages:

**TeX Live users:**
```bash
tlmgr install <package-name>
```

**MiKTeX users:**  
MiKTeX will prompt you to install missing packages automatically.

### Font not found

The template tries to use the Inter font if available, but falls back to Helvetica automatically:

```latex
\IfFileExists{inter.sty}{
  \usepackage[sfdefault]{inter}
}{
  \usepackage[scaled=0.95]{helvet}
}
```

No action is needed - the fallback works seamlessly.

### Compilation errors

If you encounter compilation errors:

1. Make sure you're using `pdflatex` (not `latex`, `xelatex`, or `lualatex`)
2. Check that all required packages are installed
3. Try running `pdflatex` twice - some references require two passes
4. Look at the `.log` file in the `examples` directory for detailed error messages
