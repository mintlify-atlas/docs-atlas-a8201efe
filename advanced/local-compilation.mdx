description: Compile the CV template locally using pdflatex and TeX Live
---

## Overview

Compiling the CV template locally gives you full control over the build process and doesn't require an internet connection. The template uses standard LaTeX packages and compiles with pdflatex.

## Requirements

### TeX Live Installation

A full TeX distribution is required. TeX Live is the recommended distribution and is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

**Installation options:**

- **From upstream (recommended)**: [Install TeX from upstream](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) for the most up-to-date packages
- **Via package manager (Ubuntu/Debian)**: `sudo apt-get install texlive-full`

<Warning>
The `texlive-full` package via apt can be outdated. Installing from upstream is recommended for the latest features and bug fixes.
</Warning>

### Required Packages

The template uses standard LaTeX packages that are included in a full TeX Live installation:

- **fontspec**: Font selection for XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX
- **geometry**: Page layout configuration
- **xcolor**: Color support
- **hyperref**: Hyperlinks and PDF metadata
- **tabularx**: Advanced table formatting

## Basic Compilation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the examples directory">
    ```bash
    cd examples
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compile with pdflatex">
    For the English version:
    ```bash
    pdflatex cv_en.tex
    ```

    For the Indonesian version:
    ```bash
    pdflatex cv_id.tex
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the output">
    The compiled PDF will be created in the same directory:
    - `examples/cv_en.pdf` (English)
    - `examples/cv_id.pdf` (Indonesian)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using the Makefile

The project includes a Makefile for automated compilation. From the project root directory:

```bash
make
```

This compiles both English and Indonesian versions in a single command.

### What the Makefile Does

The Makefile runs pdflatex **twice** for each document:

```makefile
CC = pdflatex
DIR = examples

all: $(DIR)/cv_en.pdf $(DIR)/cv_id.pdf

$(DIR)/cv_en.pdf: $(DIR)/cv_en.tex
	cd $(DIR) && $(CC) cv_en.tex && $(CC) cv_en.tex

$(DIR)/cv_id.pdf: $(DIR)/cv_id.tex
	cd $(DIR) && $(CC) cv_id.tex && $(CC) cv_id.tex
```

<Note>
Running pdflatex twice ensures that cross-references, table of contents, and page numbers are correctly resolved.
</Note>

### Cleaning Build Artifacts

To remove temporary compilation files:

```bash
make clean
```

This removes:
- `*.aux` - Auxiliary files
- `*.log` - Compilation logs
- `*.out` - Hyperref outline files
- `*.toc` - Table of contents files
- `*.fls` - File list files
- `*.fdb_latexmk` - Latexmk database files
- `*.synctex.gz` - SyncTeX files

## Compilation Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit your CV">
    Open `examples/cv_en.tex` or `examples/cv_id.tex` in your text editor.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compile the document">
    Run `make` from the project root, or:
    ```bash
    cd examples
    pdflatex cv_en.tex
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the PDF">
    Open the generated PDF file to verify your changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Iterate as needed">
    Repeat the edit-compile-review cycle until satisfied.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Font Handling

The template uses the **Inter** font when available and automatically falls back to **Helvetica** if Inter is not installed.

To use the Inter font:

1. Download from [rsms.me/inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)
2. Install the font on your system
3. Recompile the document

<Note>
The fallback to Helvetica ensures compatibility across all environments, even without Inter installed.
</Note>

## Compiler Selection

This template is designed for **pdfLaTeX**. Do not use XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX as they may produce different results.

```bash
# Correct
pdflatex cv_en.tex

# Not recommended
xelatex cv_en.tex
lualatex cv_en.tex
```
