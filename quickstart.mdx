    3. Select **pdfLaTeX** from the list

    Now you can customize the template with your own information. The file is organized into clearly marked sections:
    
    - **Header** - Your name, title, and professional summary
    - **Experience** - Work experience and internships
    - **Education** - Degrees and certifications
    - **Projects** - Personal or academic projects
    - **Organization** - Volunteer work and extracurricular activities
    - **Awards** - Recognition and achievements
    - **Software** - Technical skills and tools
    
    Look for comment banners like this to find each section:
    
    ```latex
    % -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    %  EXPERIENCE (left) | EDUCATION (right)
    % -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
